    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this coursework, you will implement the Value Iteration algorithm to compute an optimal policy for three different (but closely related) Markov Decision Processes. For your reference, the pseudo-code for the Value Iteration algorithm is reproduced below from the textbook (Reinforcement Learning, Sutton & Barto, 2018, pp. 83).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/value_iteration.png\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note the following about the pseudo-code: The set $\\mathcal{S}$ contains all non-terminal states, whereas $\\mathcal{S}^+$ is the set of all states (terminal and non-terminal). The symbol $r$ represents the immediate reward on transition from state $s$ to the next state $s'$ via action $a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bombs and gold numbers.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" align=\"left\" caption=\"Figure 1\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The three problems you will solve use variants of the gridworld environment shown on the left. You should be familiar with this kind of environment from the lectures. The grid squares in the figure are numbered as shown. In all exercises, the following are true: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions available:** The agent has four possible actions in each grid square. These are *west*, *north*, *south*, and *east*. If the direction of movement is blocked by a wall (for example, if the agent executes action south at grid square 1), the agent remains in the same grid square. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Collecting gold:** On its first arrival at a grid square that contains gold (from a neighbouring grid square), the agent collects the gold. Note that, in order to collect the gold, the agent needs to transition into the grid square (containing the gold) from a different grid square.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hitting the bomb:** On arrival at a grid square that contains a bomb (from a neighbouring grid square), the agent activates the bomb. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminal states:** The game terminates when all gold is collected or when the bomb is activated. In Exercises 1 and 2, you can define terminal states to be grid squares 18 and 23. In Exercise 3, you will need to define terminal state(s) differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions ###\n",
    "Set parameter $\\theta$ to $1 \\times 10 ^{-10}$. You can express that as `1e-10` in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Set all initial state values $V(s)$ to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use discounting (that is, set $\\gamma=1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following reward function: $-1$ for each navigation action (including when the action results in hitting the wall), an additional $+10$ for collecting each piece of gold, and an additional $-10$ for activating the bomb. For example, the immediate reward for transitioning into a square with gold (from a neighbouring grid square) is $-1 + 10 = +9$. "

    "\n",
    "The array `policy` should be a numpy array of strings that specifies an optimal action at each grid location. Please use the abbreviations `\"n\"`, `\"e\"`, `\"s\"`, and `\"w\"` for the four actions. As an example, the value of `policy` at index `0` needs to give `\"n\"`, if _north_ is an optimal action in cell 0. The policy for a terminal state can be any action. If there are multiple optimal actions from a state, any optimal action will be considered as a correct answer. \n",
